We have compared the output of bufr2netcdf with that of bufrx2netcdf.

Those are the bufr templates taken in account:

   acars
   acars uk
   acars us
   amdar
   buoy
   gps zenith
   pilot
   pilot p
   radar vad
   rass
   ship
   synop
   temp
   temp ship
   wind prof


These are the known differences:

 - Variables with scale < 0 (i.e. whose value is multiplied by 10 to the
   power of a positive number) are represented by bufr2netcdf as floats,
   instead of ints used by bufrx2netcdf.

 - bufr2netcdf contains more "references_*" attributes in the output.
   bufrx2netcdf skips at least these two cases:

    - subcentre (MMIOGS) referencing centre (MMIOGC)
    - WMO block number (MII) referencing Short station or site name (YSSOSN)

   bufr2netcdf generates "references_*" attributes normally.

 - Decoded, DWD-style optional section 2 variables are not present in
   the converted NetCDF since we do not have the specifications of the
   DWD-style section 2.

   Noted by Dreiucker Michael: "The interpretation of Section 2 corresponds to
   the usual DWD way. The variables listed within section 2 are all defined
   values. They are used for DWD internal documentation. The meaning of values
   for those variables is shown in netcdf format only (cf section2_backup_day
   e.g.)"

 - The "edition_number" variable does not have "references_*"
   attributes. Noted by Dreiucker Michael:
   "Correct. Reference of edition_number should not be evaluated"

 - Some "long_name" and "units" attributes are equivalent but slightly
   different because of a difference in the BUFR decoding tables.

 - There are cases, where the delayed replication variable has a value
   that is constant across all input BUFRs, where the DWD converter still uses
   "dim1_length=<VARIABLE_NAME>" instead of "dim1_length=_constant".

- "reference_004024" and "reference2_004024" values are swapped compared
   to the DWD converter; this can be corrected once it is confirmed that the
   order is relevant and that the order used by the DWD converter is the
   correct one.
