* Know differences with DWD converter

 - Variables with scale < 0 (i.e. whose value is multiplied by 10 to the
power of a positive number) are represented as floats instead of ints.

 - There are more "references_*" attributes in the output. Some are
dropped by the DWD converter and we failed to find a logic for it.

 - Decoded, DWD-style optional section 2 variables are not present in
the converted NetCDF since we do not have the specifications of the
DWD-style section 2. Noted by Dreiucker Michael:
"The interpretation of Section 2 corresponds to the usual DWD way
   The variables listed within section 2 are all defined values.
   They are used for DWD internal documentation.
   The meaning of values for those variables is shown in netcdf format only (cf section2_backup_day e.g.)"

 - The "edition_number" variable does not have "references_*"
attributes. Noted by Dreiucker Michael:
"Correct. Reference of edition_number should not bei evaluated"

 - Some "long_name" and "units" attributes are equivalent but slightly
different because of a difference in the BUFR decoding tables.

 - There are cases, where the delayed replication variable has a value
that is constant across all input BUFRs, where the DWD converter still
uses "dim1_length=<VARIABLE_NAME>" instead of "dim1_length=_constant".

- "reference_004024" and "reference2_004024" values are swapped compared
to the DWD converter; this can be corrected once it is confirmed that
the order is relevant and that the order used by the DWD converter is
correct.
